A savings account in a bank earns a different rate of interest depending on the balance in the account
- A balance in the range $0 up to $100 has a 3% interest rate
- A balance over $100 and up to $1000 has a 5% interest rate
- A balance of $1000 and over have a 7% interest rate

### Implement creditcard.CreditCard.getDiscount()
When a customer is getting a credit card, the customer will then receive a discount percentage, based on being a new or an existing customer and having a loyalty card or a coupon
- If you are a new customer opening a credit card account, you will get a 15% discount on all your purchases today
- If you are an existing customer and you hold a loyalty card, you get a 10% discount
- If you have a coupon, you can get 20% off today (but it can't be used with the 'new customer' discount)
